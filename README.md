Vending-Machine Tech Test (Onfido)
==================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bpourian/vending-machine.svg?token=pbZE7sGYsn5RyUv9ZzzN&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bpourian/vending-machine)


Design a vending machine using a programming language of your choice. The vending machine should perform as follows:

Once an item is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, the vending machine should return the correct product.
It should also return change if too much money is provided, or ask for more money if insufficient funds have been inserted.
The machine should take an initial load of products and change. The change will be of denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2.
There should be a way of reloading either products or change at a later point.
The machine should keep track of the products and change that it contains.
Please develop the machine in any language you are comfortable in and send over your response by tomorrow 4pm (24 hours completion time)

Please do not submit your code to Github or a publicly available repository. Just send your code to us via email or via link to a private repo, adding https://github.com/Alfreddd​
